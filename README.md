# robot-arm
Hey,
We have desided to build robot arm in simulink that will have computer vision. Our idea is to build simulation of the arm in the simulink, and connect it to our own computer vision program that will allow user to control arm via webcamer.
Our computer vision program will be in Python or in C++ (we have not desided yet).

Project is beeing build by:
Mikhail Romanov (GitHub: mkhlrmnv)
Jaakko Aalto (GitHub: ...)
